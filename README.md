# Jobs channel

[Note: these rules and their motivations have been discussed ad nauseam in the channel. Please don’t start a debate about it again in the channel. Doing so may result in a ban from the channel. We are happy to debate this and any other issues privately.]

1. Job postings must clearly be strictly related to Functional Programming
    1. Does the job involve working mostly with any of Haskell/GHCJS/PureScript/Elm/Clojure/ClojureScript/OCaml/ReasonML/F#? If "yes", you can post the job.
    2. Does the job involve working mostly with Scala AND the "cats" or “scalaz” libraries? If "yes", you can post the job.
    3. Otherwise, the job doesn't belong in this channel, so please don't post it.
2. Job postings must include a description, including at least the following information:
    1. A general description of the position.
    2. Required skills and experience.
    3. Working conditions: Location, Remote OK?, part-time/full-time
    4. A technical description of the position, demonstrating its relevance to the channel. Include details such as: programming languages, tools and frameworks used
    5 Any additional information you feel may be helpful and/or relevant.
3. Do **NOT** post misleading information
    - For example: including the keyword “Haskell” in the posting, when the job itself does not involve writing Haskell code.
4. The position must be an actual job opening being actively hired for. “Interview” processes or labor sourcing platforms that require spec work / free labor for an opportunity to be considered for the position are unacceptable. Small, useless work samples given after initial screening are fine.

**Note: you can also submit your job posting as a Github issue here https://github.com/Functional-Programming-Slack/jobs/issues with the appropriate labels.
